## 🔌 Hardware Connections

### Required Components:
- ESP32 development board
- Push button (normally open)
- 10kΩ pull-up resistor (optional - can use internal)
- LED (or use built-in LED)
- 220Ω current limiting resistor for LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Wiring Diagram:
```
ESP32 Connections:

Button Circuit:
  GPIO 0  ─┬─ Button ─┐
           │          │
           └─ 10kΩ ───┘── 3.3V (pull-up)
           │
           └────────────── GND (when pressed)

LED Circuit:
  GPIO 2  ──── 220Ω ──── LED Anode (+)
  GND     ──────────────── LED Cathode (-)
```

**Note**: Most ESP32 boards have a built-in BOOT button on GPIO 0 and LED on GPIO 2, so external components may not be needed for testing.

## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### **Test 1: Basic Button Detection**
```bash
# Build and flash
idf.py build flash monitor

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Press button → LED turns on immediately
# 2. Release button → LED turns off (in manual mode)
# 3. Console shows button events with timestamps
```

### **Test 2: Debouncing Verification**
```bash
# Monitor console output while rapidly pressing button
# Expected: Clean press/release events despite mechanical bounce
# No spurious events or multiple triggers from single press
```

### **Test 3: Event Types Testing**

#### Single Click:
```
Action: Quick press and release (< 1 second)
Expected: 
- BUTTON_EVENT_PRESSED
- BUTTON_EVENT_RELEASED  
- BUTTON_EVENT_CLICK
- Toggles auto LED mode
```

#### Long Press:
```
Action: Hold button for > 1 second
Expected:
- BUTTON_EVENT_PRESSED
- BUTTON_EVENT_LONG_PRESS (after 1 second)
- BUTTON_EVENT_RELEASED (when released)
- System reset (statistics cleared)
```

#### Double Click:
```
Action: Two quick clicks within 300ms
Expected:
- Two sets of press/release/click events
- BUTTON_EVENT_DOUBLE_CLICK
- Changes LED blink pattern (0→1→2→3→0)
```

### **Test 4: System Integration**

#### Auto Mode Testing:
```
1. System starts in auto mode (LED blinks automatically)
2. Single click → Manual mode (LED stops auto blinking)
3. Button press → LED on, release → LED off
4. Single click → Auto mode restored
```

#### Pattern Testing:
```
1. Double click changes patterns:
   - Pattern 0: Normal blink (500ms on/off)
   - Pattern 1: Fast blink (200ms on/off)
   - Pattern 2: Slow blink (1000ms on/off)  
   - Pattern 3: Morse SOS pattern
2. Each pattern cycles for ~4-6 seconds
```

## 🔍 Advanced Testing

### **Stress Testing**
```bash
# Rapid button pressing test
# Press button as fast as possible for 10 seconds
# Verify: No system crashes, clean event detection
```

### **Timing Verification**
```bash
# Long press timing test
# Press and hold exactly 1 second using stopwatch
# Verify: Long press event occurs at ~1000ms mark
```

### **Memory Management**
```bash
# Extended operation test
# Let system run for several minutes
# Monitor heap usage in status reports
# Verify: No memory leaks (heap should remain stable)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### No Button Events:
```
Check:
1. GPIO connections (GPIO 0 for button)
2. Pull-up resistor or internal pull-up enabled
3. Button wiring (active low configuration)
4. ISR service installation in logs
```

#### Multiple Events from Single Press:
```
Solution:
1. Increase debounce time in menuconfig
2. Check button quality (mechanical bounce)
3. Verify proper pull-up resistor
```

#### LED Not Responding:
```
Check:
1. LED controller initialization successful
2. GPIO 2 connections
3. LED polarity and current limiting resistor
```

#### System Crashes:
```
Debug:
1. Check console for stack traces
2. Verify proper mutex usage
3. Monitor heap usage for memory leaks
4. Ensure ISR functions are IRAM_ATTR
```
